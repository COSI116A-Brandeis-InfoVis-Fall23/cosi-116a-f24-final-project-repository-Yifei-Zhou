    <p><strong>Yifei Zhou</strong>, <strong>Chengpeng Gao</strong>, <strong>Qifeng He</strong>, <strong>Suinan
        Xiao</strong></p>

    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a
        href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis
        University</a>.</p>

    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p>Our project focuses on analyzing MBTA ridership data through interactive visualizations to uncover insights into
      ridership patterns across different transportation modes, time periods, and stops. By visualizing these patterns,
      we aim to provide actionable insights into how Boston’s public transportation system is utilized, helping
      transportation planners and stakeholders make informed decisions about resource allocation and service
      improvements. Specifically, our work highlights trends in monthly ridership by mode, temporal variations in rail
      ridership, and spatial-temporal ridership flow across subway stops. These insights contribute to better
      understanding the performance of Boston’s public transportation network and identifying areas for optimization.
    </p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <h3>Fall 2023 MBTA Rail Ridership Data by SDP Time Period, Route/Line, and Stop</h3>
    <a href="https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/80a379ebaa374cfd836ca4d3880ceda4_0/explore">Source:
      Massachusetts geoDOT</a>
    <p>
      The dataset used for this project contains MBTA rail ridership data by route,
      time period, and stop. The key columns include route_name, time_period_name,
      average_flow, and other attributes detailing public transit information.
      The dataset captures ridership statistics across various subway lines, including
      metrics for different time periods throughout the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data types primarily consist of categorical variables
      (route_name, time_period_name) and numerical variables (average_flow).
      The categorical data represents the subway lines and time intervals,
      while the numerical data represents ridership counts (average flow).
    </p>
    <p>
      During data preprocessing, we grouped the data by route_name and
      time_period_name to analyze ridership trends across different subway lines
      and time periods. We calculated the mean average_flow for each combination of
      route and time period, while also ensuring logical sorting of the time
      periods (e.g., VERY_EARLY_MORNING, AM_PEAK, MIDDAY_SCHOOL) to accurately
      reflect the order of events throughout a day. Additionally, the OFF_PEAK
      category was excluded to focus on the more significant ridership periods.
      The preprocessing steps aimed to clean, structure, and format the data for
      effective visualization and analysis.
    </p>

    <h3>Fall 2023 MBTA Monthly Ridership Data by Mode</h3>
    <a href="https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a2d15ddd86b34867a31cd4b8e0a83932_0/explore">Source:
      Massachusetts geoDOT</a>

    <p>The dataset used in this project consists of monthly MBTA ridership data broken down by transit mode, sourced
      from the file MBTA_Monthly_Ridership_By_Mode.csv. Each record provides a snapshot of monthly weekday ridership,
      identified by a service_date field formatted as “YYYY/MM,” a mode field indicating the type of transit service
      (e.g., bus, rapid transit, commuter rail, ferry), and a total_monthly_weekday_ridership field containing numeric
      ridership counts. This structure allows for detailed time-series analysis of how different transit modes perform
      over various months.</p>
    <p>Before visualization and analysis, the data undergoes several preprocessing steps to ensure it is appropriately
      structured and typed. The service_date strings are parsed into JavaScript Date objects using
      d3.timeParse("%Y/%m"), facilitating accurate time-based plotting. Additionally, the
      total_monthly_weekday_ridership values, initially loaded as strings, are converted into numerical types, enabling
      proper scaling, axis generation, and arithmetic operations in the subsequent visualization.</p>
    <p>Following these conversions, the dataset is grouped by mode and sorted chronologically by service_date. This
      grouping and sorting ensure that each mode’s data forms a continuous time series, ready for line chart plotting.
      As a result, the final processed dataset is clean, consistently typed, and logically organized, allowing
      researchers to straightforwardly compare monthly ridership trends across various MBTA transit modes.</p>
    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>
    <p>These visualizations are designed to help stakeholders—such as transportation planners, transit agencies, and
      policy analysts—understand patterns in MBTA ridership data, enabling them to make informed decisions about
      resource allocation, scheduling, and improvements to the transit system.</p>
    <p>The tasks supported by these visualizations include identifying long-term trends in ridership across different
      transportation modes, pinpointing peak usage times and routes for rail services, and examining spatial-temporal
      patterns in ridership volume at individual stops. Goals at the domain level involve informing decision-making
      about service adjustments, enhancing reliability, and improving the rider experience. The “monthlyridershipbymode”
      charts allow users to compare how different modes (e.g., buses, commuter rail, subways) fluctuate over months or
      years, revealing seasonal factors or policy impacts. The “railridershipbytime” visualization focuses on the
      temporal dimension, showing how average ridership changes during various time periods of the day or week, enabling
      planners to refine scheduling and predict demand. Finally, the “ridershipheatmap” emphasizes correlation between
      stops and specific time frames, visually highlighting where and when ridership is most intense, thus guiding
      improvements in station facilities or targeted marketing efforts.</p>
    <p>From these capabilities, users can abstract tasks such as filtering data to isolate particular modes or time
      periods, brushing and zooming to focus on interesting data segments, and highlighting to compare specific routes
      or stops. On a higher level, the processes supported by these tools lead to more effective strategic planning and
      operational adjustments. Ultimately, by making it easier to analyze complex ridership information, these
      visualizations help transportation authorities achieve the larger goal of creating a more efficient, rider-focused
      transit network.</p>
    <h1>Design Process</h1>

    <p>Our design process followed an iterative approach, starting with sketches, theoretical grounding, iterative
      development, and feedback-driven refinements.</p>

    <h3>1. Initial Sketches</h3>
    <p>We sketched visualizations to address key questions: <em>How does ridership change over time?</em> and <em>Where
        and when is ridership concentrated?</em> Line charts were chosen for monthly trends and
      temporal rail ridership, while heatmaps were selected for spatial-temporal
      patterns to effectively encode ridership flow.</p>

    <h3>2. Theoretical Grounding</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Visual Encodings:</strong> Position, color, and intensity were used to display time, modes, and
        ridership levels clearly.</li>
      <li><strong>Interactivity:</strong> Features like zooming, brushing, and filtering were added to enable focused
        exploration.</li>
      <li><strong>Color Schemes:</strong> Distinct colors differentiated modes, and sequential scales represented
        ridership intensity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Iterative Improvement</h3>
    <p>Based on peer feedback:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tooltips and axis labels were added for clarity.</li>
      <li>Legends were improved for readability.</li>
      <li>Heatmap color gradients were adjusted for accuracy and accessibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Final Outcome</h3>
    <p>The final visualizations—monthly ridership trends, temporal rail ridership, and
      the ridership heatmap—are interactive and user-friendly. They provide clear insights into MBTA
      ridership patterns, supporting tasks like filtering, highlighting, and analyzing trends effectively.</p>


    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Throughout this project, we explored MBTA ridership patterns using various visualization techniques to uncover
      meaningful insights. We examined long-term trends across multiple transportation modes, identified temporal usage
      patterns within the rail network, and highlighted where and when ridership is most concentrated through heatmaps.
      These visualizations supported interactive tasks like zooming, brushing, highlighting, and filtering—enabling
      transportation planners, policy analysts, and other stakeholders to navigate complex datasets more efficiently and
      derive actionable recommendations for system improvements.</p>
    <p>Looking forward, there are several avenues to enhance this work. Incorporating more granular, real-time data
      would allow for analyzing dynamic demand fluctuations and adjusting strategies on the fly. Adding geo-spatial
      mapping layers with interactive route-planning features could provide further context for congestion hot-spots,
      while integrating rider feedback surveys and operational costs would enable a richer understanding of value and
      satisfaction. Finally, applying machine learning or predictive modeling techniques to the underlying data could
      help anticipate future demand patterns, guiding long-term strategic decisions and infrastructure investments.</p>
